# Breadcrumbs
An algorithmic trail routing system

Building sustainable trails is important. A badly routed trail can cause erosion and damage the environment, and a poor experience for trail users.
Drafting a trail route is generally done by hand, with a GIS mapping application. Breadcrumbs aims to assist with research on how to automatically generate sustainable trail routes. Given elevation data, a set of weights, and zero or more extra map layers, Breadcrumbs will attempt to find the best route across the given terrain.
